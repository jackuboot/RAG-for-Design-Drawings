# RAG System for Architectural Drawing Question Answering

A Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system that answers natural language questions about architectural/construction drawing sets.

## Overview

This system processes large PDF architectural drawings (~60MB, 20-30 pages) and answers questions about floor plans, schedules, title blocks, and specifications. It uses hybrid retrieval (semantic + keyword search) with intelligent OCR fallback for information extraction from both text layers and drawings.

**Key Features:**
- Hybrid retrieval (FAISS vector search + BM25 keyword search)
- Intelligent OCR fallback for graphics-heavy content
- Grounded answers with citations (page, section, bounding box)
- Zero hallucination (returns "no evidence found" when uncertain)
- Fast (~2 seconds per query)
- Runs locally on CPU (no GPU or cloud required)

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Tesseract OCR
- 16GB RAM recommended

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone git@github.com:ishamishra0408/RAG-for-Design-Drawings.git
cd rag_drawings

# Install Python dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

```

### Setup

```bash
# 1. Place your PDF in the project directory
cp ./data/tech_arch_drawing.pdf ./drawing.pdf

# 2. Update config.yaml with your PDF path
# Edit config.yaml and set:
#   pdf_path: "./drawing.pdf"

  "confidence": 0.90,
  "citations": [
    {
      "sheet_id": "A1",
      "page": 1,
      "section": "title block",
      "bbox": "124.4,44.7,2523.7,524.5"

### Components

**1. Retrieval (Hybrid)**
- **FAISS** (semantic search): Top 100 chunks
- **BM25** (keyword search): Top 200 chunks
- **RRF fusion**: Combines results using Reciprocal Rank Fusion

**2. Answer Extraction**
- **Specialized handlers**: Fire sprinkler, energy code, window count, floor finish, etc.
- **Generic extractive fallback**: Salient line extraction with confidence scoring
- **OCR fallback**: Tesseract OCR for graphics-heavy content

**3. Grounding**
- **Domain gate**: Rejects out-of-scope questions
- **Confidence threshold**: Returns "no evidence found" if confidence < 0.50
- **Sheet verification**: Validates requested sheets exist
- **Text quality checks**: Answer length 10-300 characters

## Design Decisions & Trade-offs

### Chunking Strategy

**Decision:** Section-based chunking (title blocks, floor plans, schedules, notes)

**Why:**
- Preserves logical document structure
- Easier citation (users understand "title block" vs "chunk 47")
- Better retrieval relevance

**Trade-off:** More complex parsing vs simple sliding-window chunking

### Hybrid Retrieval

**Decision:** FAISS (semantic) + BM25 (keyword) + RRF fusion

**Why:**
- FAISS catches semantic similarity ("sprinkler" ≈ "fire suppression")
- BM25 catches exact terms ("W1" window code)
- RRF combines strengths of both

**Trade-off:** Slower than single retriever, but significantly more accurate

### Specialized Handlers vs Generic

**Decision:** Build specialized handlers for common question types (sprinkler, energy code, window schedules)

**Why:**
- Architectural drawings have predictable patterns
- Specialized logic gets 85-90% confidence vs 60-70% generic
- Better user experience with precise answers

**Trade-off:** More code to maintain, but much better accuracy

### OCR Fallback

**Decision:** Use OCR when text layer fails

**Why:**
- 70-80% of architectural drawings are graphics
- Text layer often poor quality or missing
- Essential for answering questions about floor plans, dimensions

**Trade-off:** Slower (~2s with OCR vs ~0.5s text-only), but necessary for completeness

## Performance

### Test Results (6 Questions)

| Metric | Result |
|--------|--------|
| **Answer Accuracy** | 83% (5/6 correct) |
| **Retrieval Accuracy** | 100% (6/6 found correct sections) |
| **Hallucinations** | 0 (no false information) |
| **Citation Coverage** | 100% (6/6 have citations) |
| **Average Latency** | ~2.1 seconds |

### Resource Usage

| Resource | Usage |
|----------|-------|
| **RAM** | ~85 MB (0.5% of 16GB) |
| **Disk** | ~61 MB (PDF + index) |
| **CPU** | No GPU required |

---

## Known Limitations

### 1. Window Schedule Counting (Q2)
**Issue:** Reports 5 windows instead of 7

**Root Cause:** 
- Text layer missing IDs 3 and 5
- OCR struggles with structured table parsing

**Impact:** Medium (affects one specific question type)

**Production Fix:** Use specialized table parsing library (pdfplumber, camelot)

### 2. Empty sheet_id in Some Citations
**Issue:** Some citations show `"sheet_id": ""`

**Root Cause:** Sheet IDs not extracted during PDF chunking/indexing

**Impact:** Minor (page + bbox still allows verification)

**Production Fix:** Add sheet ID extraction to indexing pipeline

### 3. Building Height Limit (Additional Test)
**Issue:** Cannot reliably extract from site plan drawings

**Root Cause:** 
- Text layer doesn't contain height limit info
- OCR finds "HEAD HEIGHT" (door headers) instead

**Impact:** Low (one edge case)

**Production Fix:** Computer vision for drawing annotation detection

## Development

### Running Tests

```bash
# Test specific question
python qa.py "your question here"

# Test all 6 sample questions
./test_all.sh  # (if provided)
```

### Adding New Handlers

To add a new specialized handler for a question type:

1. Add handler before "GENERIC EXTRACTIVE FALLBACK" section in `qa.py`
2. Follow pattern: keyword detection → text layer search → OCR fallback
3. Return with proper citations

Example structure:
```python
if "your_keyword" in q_lower:
    log("your_handler: searching...")
    # Search text layer
    for c in chunks:
        if match_found:
            return {
                "answer": "...",
                "confidence": 0.85,
                "citations": [_build_citation(c)]
            }
    # OCR fallback
    if pdf_path and budget_ok():
        ocr_text = ocr_text_from_bbox(...)
    # Return "no evidence found" if nothing found
    return {"answer": "no evidence found", ...}
```
